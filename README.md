[![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-InterviewTest-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://android-arsenal.com/details/3/5377)

An Android Project for developers to use as a template in order to speed up building
an interview test from scratch.

You can read the Steps and Tips to speed up your interview tests in the following article:

**medium:** [Technical Interview Tests](https://medium.com/@kuassivi/technical-interview-tests-2b4794aa0070)


Technologies involved
-

- [Layered Architecture Pattern][1] ([Clean Architecture][2])
- [Reactive Programming][9] with [RxJava][8]
- [Dependency Injection][3] with [Dagger 2][4]
- Android View [Binding][17] with [Butterknife][5]
- [Repository Pattern][6]
- [HTTP Client API][7]
- [Unit Test][10] following [TDD First][11] approach ([JUnit][12])
- [Testing UI][14] with [Espresso][14] ([black-box testing][15])


Some questions you might be asking
-

* **How can I test large amount of data from a mocked request like a JSON file?**

* **How can I chain and make parallel requests with RxJava and Retrofit?**

* **How can I take control of Dagger 2 modules and implement `IdlingResource` in Espresso tests?**

* **How can I override default Schedulers?**

* **How can I deal with Threads in RxJava (Unit Tests specific)?**
