# Skeleton Project for Interview Tests

[![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-InterviewTest-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://android-arsenal.com/details/3/5377)

An Android Project for developers to use as a template in order to speed up building
a interview test from scratch.

You can read what decisions and considerations were taken while developing this sample in
the following article:

**Medium:** [Technical Interview Tests](https://medium.com/@kuassivi/technical-interview-tests-2b4794aa0070)


Some frequently questions you might be asking
-

* **How can I test large amount of data from a mocked request like a JSON file?**

   Have a view into _/data/src/test/_ `MockResponseDispatcher` class and see how it is handled.

    ```java
    new File(classLoader.getResource(fileName).getFile())
    ```

* **How can I chain and make parallel requests with RxJava and Retrofit?**

    Look straight into the _/data/.../interactor/_ `GetPostList` class and you'll find a particular strategy
    that uses `groupBy` and `flatMap` [RxJava Operators][16] plus the number of available
    processors in the device, to achieve the parallelism execution.

* **How can I take control of Dagger 2 modules and implement `IdlingResource` in Espresso tests?**

    Pay a special attention into the _/app/src/androidTest/.../feature/_ `EspressoTest` class.

    Remember you need to attach `EspressoTestRunner` to your Run/Debug Configurations in Android Studio.

* **How can I override default Schedulers?**

    Have a look into the _/data/src/test/_ `RxJavaTestRunner` class and you will see Hooks implementation
    and how to use it for RxJava v1.2

    ```java
    RxJavaHooks.reset();
    RxJavaHooks.setOnIOScheduler(scheduler -> Schedulers.immediate());
    RxJavaHooks.setOnNewThreadScheduler(scheduler -> Schedulers.immediate());
    ```

* **How can I deal with Threads in RxJava (Unit Tests specific)?**

    The quick answer is by using `TestScheduler` class.

    Although in order to use it properly, you must implement your code with the ability
    to pass the `Scheduler` you want as a parameter, normally in the constructor of your class.

    ```java
    public interface ThreadExecutor {
        Scheduler getScheduler();
    }

    ...

    public class ClassToBeTested {
        public ClassToBeTested(ThreadExecutor executor) {
            // any implementation that uses ThreadExecutor#getScheduler()
        }
    }

    ...

    ThreadExecutor mockThreadExecutor = mock(ThreadExecutor.class);
    ClassToBeTested classToBeTested = new ClassToBeTested(mockThreadExecutor);

    TestScheduler testScheduler = new TestScheduler();
    given(mockThreadExecutor.getScheduler()).willReturn(testScheduler);

    // An execution that uses that Scheduler
    classToBeTested.execute();
    testScheduler.triggerActions();
    ```
